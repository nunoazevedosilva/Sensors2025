    "In the Young's Double Slit experiment we have a laser that is divided in two wavefronts by a double slit. Each of the slits will act as a cylindrical wave source, which will interfere at the observation plane. The temporal coherence (necessary for interference) is warranted by the wavefront division mechanism (the double slit) as long as the distance between the slits is below the spatial coherence length.\n",

    "When the beam is expanded, we can use an angle between two beams to probe its wavefront. This methodology - digital **digital off-axis holography** may also be utilized as a sensor in multiple manners (e.g. detection of tiny spatial distributions of index of refraction, such as gas sensing, curvature of transparent objects, birefringence).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, we will explore how a Mach–Zehnder interferometer can be used to perform **digital off-axis holography**. A Mach–Zehnder interferometer splits a coherent beam (e.g., from a laser) into two separate arms—an **object arm** and a **reference arm**—and then recombines them, producing interference fringes when detected by an imaging sensor. By carefully arranging the geometry so that the reference beam makes a small angle with respect to the object beam, we create an **off-axis configuration**. \n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/mz.png\" class=\"bg-primary\" height=\"400px\"> \n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "This off-axis arrangement is what enables digital holography: when we record the resulting interferogram, we can numerically retrieve the amplitude and phase of the object wavefront.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object Beam  $E_3$**  \n",
    "   This beam passes through or reflects from the sample (or object). As shown in the figure, you may insert an object in the path where \\( E_3 \\) propagates. Any phase changes or modifications to the beam caused by the object are carried into the final interference pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reference Beam $E_4$**  \n",
    "   The reference beam provides a well-defined phase and amplitude profile—essentially serving as a “clean” wavefront for comparison. When the reference beam is recombined with the object beam, the recorded interference reveals both the amplitude and phase information of \\( E_3 \\) relative to \\( E_4 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Off-Axis Geometry**  \n",
    "   To retrieve the hologram digitally, we introduce a small angle between the reference beam and the object beam. This slight angular separation shifts the interference fringes in space, allowing us to separate the real and virtual images in the spatial-frequency domain after we perform a Fourier transform on the recorded pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Digital Reconstruction**  \n",
    "   Once we record the interferogram with a camera, we use numerical methods—Fourier transforms and filtering—to extract the complex wavefield of the object beam. By doing so, we can reconstruct the object’s amplitude and phase distribution, forming the basis for **digital holographic imaging**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we supply some experimental data obtained with the setup above, in figures **profile_x.png** and **interference_x.png** (x=1,2,3) of the folder MZ. Your task is to reconstruct the complex field (i.e. intensity profile and phase) for each of the field.\n",
